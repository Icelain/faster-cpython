# A faster CPython


## Five times faster

We want to speed up CPython by a factor of 5 over the next four releases.

See [the plan](./plan.md) for how this can be done.

## Paying for it

Making CPython faster by this amount will require funding.
Relying on the goodwill and spare time of the core developers is not sufficient.

See [funding](./funding.md) for my thoughts on how the money can be found.
